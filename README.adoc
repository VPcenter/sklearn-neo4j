= sklearn-neo4j: Save your scikit-learn models in Neo4j

This is a WIP project for saving scikit-learn models to Neo4j.

You can install it using the following command:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/neo4j-graph-analytics/sklearn-neo4j.git#egg=sklearn-neo4j
```

== How do I use it?

Here's a simple example showing how to save and load a BayesianRidge model.
